# airos-letsencrypt

Generate and install LetsEncrypt TLS certificates for Ubiquiti AirOS devices.

## Requirements

* A compatible Ubiquiti device running AirOS.
  * HTTPS and SSH must be enabled in the device configuration.
* A system running a compatible (most likely Unix-like) OS.
  * You must have `certbot` installed, ideally 0.17.0 or higher.
  * You'll also need some standard tools: `ssh`, `openssl`.
  * You must be able to SSH into your AirOS devices from this system, using the same domain name as the cert.
    * E.g. if you want your device to be `https://nanobeam.example.org`, then `ssh nanobeam.example.org` must work.
    * Update your `~/.ssh/config` as necessary to make this work.
    * It is strongly recommended to use an SSH agent or passwordless SSH key.
* A DNSimple account, authoritative for the domain you intend to use.
  * You can use other DNS providers supported by `certbot` plugins, but that's up to you to set up.
  * You'll need to install the plugin: `pip install certbot-dns-dnsimple`

## Instructions

1. Copy `conf/dnsimple.ini.example` to `conf/dnsimple.ini` and input an account API access token.
  * Find this under Account settings â†’ Access tokens.
2. Run `./generate.sh fqdn1 fqdn2 fqdn3` (etc.) where each fqdn is the fully-qualified domain name (e.g. `name.example.org`) of one of your nanobeam devices.
  * E.g. `./generate.sh nanobeam1.example.org nanobeam2.example.org`
  * The first time you run this, you will be prompted for various pieces of info.
3. Periodically, run `./renew.sh fqdn1 fqdn2 fqdn3` (etc.) to renew your certificates.
  * It's recommended you run this in a daily cronjob.
  * Certs will not be renewed unless they are near expiry.
  * Note that if you just run `./renew.sh` without any hostnames, certs will be renewed, but will not be installed.

## Caveats

`certbot` uses absolute paths in its renewal configuration files.  If you move this project to a different directory, you'll need to edit `etc/renewal/*.conf` to respect the path change (or create a symlink at the old location).

## Compatibility

Tested with two Ubiquiti Nanobeam 5AC Gen2 devices.  Compatibility with other devices is unknown.

Developed and tested on Debian Linux (sid) using certbot 0.17.0.
